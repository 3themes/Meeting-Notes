#Meeting 11-26-2013

1. Sass mixin - multicolor gradient
  * still need some help with some legacy/compatibility in old Android 2.3, Safari 5.0 and IE
2. Sassquatch in the wild
  * More complete than the prior mixin library
  * Being used in other live production - please report the bugs!
  * Need 3D transforms 
  * Need more Flexbox mixins
    * (yes it does work through IE10/7 with polyfill)
    * Let's do this closer to the end so it's less out of date 
  * More design pattern mixins
  * Mixins for the CSS grid templates (coming soon!)
3. Theme development
  * Separate development of another theme to combine later this weekend
  * Some additions of custom menus, post formats etc.
  * Listed under Kiko's account, called Starter
4. Design
  * Updated typography
  * New site elements
  * Tackling navigation next
5. This is where we talked about bash scripting and I have no idea what's going on so I took lousy notes... :)
6. Going on a tangent about local development and Vagrant and Grunt
  * Yeoman scripts? I am not qualified to be taking these notes.
7. Using a Grunt setup for our workflow
  * Grunt tasks that remove unised CSS and Sass (but can ignore the items being used in the content)
  * Combines and orders media queries
  * Ruby gem called Sass media query combiner [https://github.com/aaronjensen/sass-media_query_combiner](https://github.com/aaronjensen/sass-media_query_combiner)
  * Source maps 
8. Goal: Spring theme official alpha release
  * OO PHP/Twig? if we do this it needs to be in the first version
  * Probably too much of a learning curve
  * Theme wrappers "bite sized" template system (look at Roots as a great example)
  * Talk about hosting
9. Also another tangent about webp format
