3. Git Submodules
  * Some issues but it's good

  * Why? Use one git repo inside another without causing any conflicts
    * Create a logical connection between one and the other
    * Set a specific canonical commit in Sassquatch for Spring Theme
  * WordPress and submodules for version control

  * Worry about functionality and less about looks
  * Focus on: form elements, buttons, list, drop down, etc.
